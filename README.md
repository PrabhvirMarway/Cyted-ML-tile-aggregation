# Cyted-ML-tile-aggregation
Internship project

The overall aim is to train a model so that it can predict, based on the matrix probabilities from the H&E and TFF3 slides, each of the four “ground-truth” observations from the pathologist’s reading of the slides and from the endoscopy. The endoscopic results would be considered as the gold standard. As it stands, probabilities are reported on the tile level; what we want is an aggregation of these to produce a single output probability on the slide (patient) level.
